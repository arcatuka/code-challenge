# Scoreboard Module

This module is responsible for managing the scoreboard and ensuring real-time updates for users' scores. It is designed with secure APIs and WebSocket functionality for efficient and reliable operations.

---

## Module Overview

The module includes the following functionalities:

1. **Update Score API**:

   - **Endpoint**: `POST /update-score`
   - **Purpose**: Updates the score of a user upon a valid action.

2. **Scoreboard API**:

   - **Endpoint**: `GET /scoreboard`
   - **Purpose**: Fetches the top 10 scores for the leaderboard.

3. **WebSocket Service**:

   - **Purpose**: Pushes live updates to connected clients when scores are updated.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**:

   - Ensures only authorized actions can update scores.

5. **Rate Limiting**:

   - Prevents abuse by limiting the number of API calls from a single user in a defined timeframe.

6. **Database**:
   - Stores user data, scores, and timestamps of updates.

## Suggestions for Improvement

Here are some suggestions for improving the module:

1. **Error Handling**:

   - Add detailed error responses for scenarios like:
     - Invalid user IDs.
     - Missing or invalid tokens.
     - Database connection issues.
   - Provide error codes for better debugging (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`).

2. **Pagination for Scoreboard**:

   - Extend the `/scoreboard` API to allow pagination.
   - Add query parameters like `?page=1&limit=10` to fetch specific chunks of leaderboard data.

3. **Validation**:

   - Use a validation library (e.g., **Joi** or **Express Validator**) to ensure:
     - `userId` is valid and exists.
     - `increment` is a positive number.
     - Tokens are in the correct format.

4. **Environment Variables**:

   - Store sensitive data like database credentials, JWT secrets, and API keys in a `.env` file.
   - Use a library like **dotenv** to manage these variables securely.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for critical functionality:
     - `/update-score`: Ensure scores are updated correctly.
     - `/scoreboard`: Verify only the top 10 scores are fetched.
   - Use testing tools like **Jest** or **Mocha**.

## Example Enhancements (For Better Scalability and Security)

- **Caching**:

  - Use a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to store the top 10 scores. This reduces database reads for frequently accessed data.

- **WebSocket Enhancements**:

  - Use a message broker like **Redis Pub/Sub** for managing WebSocket connections if scaling to multiple servers.

- **Audit Logs**:
  - Log every score update (with user ID, timestamp, and action details) for tracking and fraud detection.
