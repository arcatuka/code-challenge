A Crude Server

This project is a backend server built with Express.js and TypeScript, designed to perform CRUD operations for managing resources. It uses SQLite for database storage, managed via Sequelize ORM.

Adding the Database

This project uses SQLite as the database, and Sequelize is configured to manage database operations.

1. The database file (database.sqlite) will be created automatically in the project root directory upon running the application.
2. You donâ€™t need to manually set up the database, as Sequelize will handle the initialization and table creation.

Starting the Application
Steps

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

2. Install Dependencies:

npm install

# or

yarn install

3. Once the server is running, access the application at: http://localhost:3000
